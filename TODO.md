### Tasks

1. Display the list of users:
    - Fetch the users from the API and display them using jQuery.
    - Design must be responsive (using Bootstrap), according to the pictures in the `screenshots/` folder.
2. Paginate the results by adding a 'Show more' link below the list which loads 8 more users every time.
3. Add a 'Sort by name / Sort by score' toggle.
4. Add a search field that queries the users by name.
5. Refactor server side to move any logic to an external service

Note: Every operation needs to be processed in the server (pagination, sorting, filtering...)
